>>> Large code bases spread over large teams

---

>>> This is complex!

Get ready to read some code. <Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/5.js" file="5.js" />

```notes
I really wanted to give this talk entierly in VSCode. Instead I will give it mostly in VSCode 🤣
```

---

>>> Controllers

Where I work we had controllers that looked something like this: <Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/6.js" />

---

>>> This gave us scattered logic required high mental load

```notes
talk here about things like:

* on boarding
* bug fixing
* testing
```

---

>> How do we do better?

* Write more declarative code.

```notes
A lot of our code exists as Obscure, implicit patterns that can only scale as fast as knowledge scales
```

---
>> 🗺

* **Fun**-ctional programming principles in JavaScript
* Introduction to RxJS
* Declarative RxJS Controllers

---

> What do we want end up with? <Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/9.js" file="9.js"/>

---
> Functional Programming Principles

* Basics
* Pureness
* Composability

> Pureness

<Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/18.js" file="18.js"/>
---
> Composability

<Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/16.js" file="16.js"/>
<Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/19.js" file="19.js"/>
---
>> But, Composability only works if programmers get good at naming 🙄
<Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/21.js" file="21.js"/>
---
> A good compose is about giving the reader of your story the understanding of each chapter.
<Link href="vscode:///Users/Sgt-Wikkidoo/github/rxjs6-controllers/23.js" file="23.js"/>
---
>> Not bad!
>>> Was it worth it? 🤔

```notes
if we all wrote code like that our "junior devs" would have a much lower barrier to entry and more senior devs would require less brain capacity to debug and fix complex issues!
```
---
>>> I think so.
>>> Let's take it one step further
---

>>>> Why 😕

```notes
these are all semantic, you will understand them with time and knowledge
```
---
>> But how do we achive the goal of making our code declarative?
